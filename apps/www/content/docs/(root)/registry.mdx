## What is the Registry?

The Creative Tim UI registry is a centralized catalog system that enables CLI-based component installation. Unlike traditional npm packages where components are locked in external dependencies, our registry delivers components as source code directly into your project.

## How the Registry Works

When you run the installation command, the CLI:

1. **Fetches Component Metadata**: Retrieves the component definition from our registry endpoint
2. **Downloads Dependencies**: Identifies and installs required npm packages
3. **Copies Source Files**: Places component files directly into your codebase
4. **Manages Imports**: Automatically configures path aliases and imports

## Registry Structure

Each component in the registry includes:

- **Component Source Code**: The actual React component files
- **Type Definitions**: Full TypeScript support with strict types
- **Dependencies**: List of required npm packages (Radix UI, etc.)
- **Files Metadata**: Information about where files should be placed
- **Registry Dependencies**: Other registry components it depends on

## Installation Endpoints

Components are available through JSON endpoints:

```bash
# Base UI Components
/r/button.json
/r/card.json
/r/avatar.json

# Custom Blocks
/r/testimonials-09.json
```

These endpoints return structured JSON that the CLI uses to install components.

## Registry vs NPM

| Feature | Registry (Source Code) | NPM Package |
|---------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Customization** | Full control, edit directly | Limited to props/config |
| **Updates** | Manual, opt-in | Automatic via package manager |
| **Bundle Size** | Only what you use | Entire package included |
| **Version Control** | Part of your codebase | External dependency |
| **Flexibility** | Modify, extend freely | Constrained by package API |

## Registry Components

The Creative Tim UI registry currently includes:

- **47 Base UI Components**: All shadcn/ui components (button, card, avatar, etc.)
- **5+ Custom Blocks**: Pre-built sections like testimonials, forms, and more
- **Full TypeScript Support**: Type-safe component definitions
- **Dark Mode Ready**: Built-in theme support with CSS variables

## Private Components

The registry supports private components with API key authentication for PRO features:

- Access control via Bearer tokens or API keys
- Gated installation for premium components
- Environment variable support for CI/CD workflows

Learn more about authentication in the [Setup](/docs/setup) guide.

## Best Practices

1. **Install Only What You Need**: Each component is standalone, no bloat
2. **Customize After Install**: Treat installed components as your own code
3. **Version Control**: Commit installed components to your repository
4. **Update Selectively**: Re-run install commands to update specific components
