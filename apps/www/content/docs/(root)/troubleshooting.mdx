## Components appear unstyled

Verify your project has the correct Tailwind CSS configuration for shadcn/ui. Your `globals.css` file should import Tailwind and include shadcn/ui base styles for proper component rendering.

---

## CLI installation completes but no files appear

Check these common issues:

- Confirm you're running the command from your project root directory (where `package.json` is located).
- Verify your `components.json` configuration file has the correct settings if you're using shadcn-style setup.
- Use the latest CLI version to ensure compatibility:

```bash
npx @creative-tim/ui@latest components add orb
```

## Theme toggle stuck on light mode

Your application needs to use the same theme system as shadcn/ui. The components expect a `data-theme` attribute on the `<html>` element. Check your `tailwind.config.js` to ensure it's configured with the appropriate class or data selectors for theme switching.

## Import errors showing "module not found"

Confirm the component file exists in your project. If it does, check your `tsconfig.json` has the correct path mapping for the `@/` alias:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```
