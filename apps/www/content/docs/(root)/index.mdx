Creative Tim UI is a component library and custom registry built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) to help you build multimodal agentic experiences faster. It provides pre-built components for agents, transcription, audio & more.

Components are available via the `@creative-tim/ui` command.

```bash
npx @creative-tim/ui@latest components add <component>
```

For example, to install the [Orb](/docs/components/orb) component, you can run:

```bash
npx @creative-tim/ui@latest components add orb
```

Here are some basic examples of what you can achieve using components from Creative Tim UI.
