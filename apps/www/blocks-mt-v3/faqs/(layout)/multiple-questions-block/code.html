What matters is the people who are sparked by it. And the people who are like offended by it, it doesn&#x27;t matter. Because it&#x27;s about motivating the doers. Because I&#x27;m here to follow my dreams and inspire other people to follow their dreams, too. We&#x27;re not always in the position that we want to be at.</p>

Thoughts- their perception of themselves! They&#x27;re slowed down by their perception of themselves. If you&#x27;re taught you can&#x27;t do anything, you won&#x27;t do anything. I was taught I could do everything.</p>
