We&#x27;re constantly making mistakes. We&#x27;re constantly trying to express ourselves and actualize our dreams. If you have the opportunity to play this game of life you need to appreciate every moment. A lot of people don&#x27;t appreciate the moment until it&#x27;s passed.</p>

What matters is the people who are sparked by it. And the people who are like offended by it, it doesn&#x27;t matter. Because it&#x27;s about motivating the doers. Because I&#x27;m here to follow my dreams and inspire other people to follow their dreams, too. We&#x27;re not always in the position that we want to be at.</p>
